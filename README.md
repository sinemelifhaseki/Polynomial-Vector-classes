# Polynomial-Vector-classes
Implementation of classes for two mathematical expressions: Polynomials and Vectors(not to be confused with std::vector). These classes will hold necessary information to represent the data, and will also support some of the mathematical
operations of these expressions: In Polynomial class, I implemented polynomial addition and multiplication and in Vector class, I implemented vector addition, scalar multiplication and dot product. Also a user interface for users to perform
operations with Polynomials and Vectors.
